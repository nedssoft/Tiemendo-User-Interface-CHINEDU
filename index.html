                <h3><span><i class="fas fa-leaf"> </i></span> Credit Extension Package</h3>
                <p>CEP is our innovative package that eliminates the capital constraints limiting farmers ability to
                  increase crop productivity and the adoption of improved farm technologies. With our CEP, farmers
                  access fertilizers and seeds when they most need it at their convenience. They receive training and
                  field extension to enforce appropriate usage of inputs and implementation of good agricultural
                  practices. Without markets, farmers are less motivated to increase production – linking farmers to
                  favorable markets is our topmost priority.</p>

                  subsistence farmer to a commercial farmer through mechanization. I had large expanse of land but
                  hadn't enough manpower and labour to explore the land resources fully, Tieme Ndo came in and provided
                  loans and machineries. Now I'm one of the major exporters of rice in Ghana.</p>
